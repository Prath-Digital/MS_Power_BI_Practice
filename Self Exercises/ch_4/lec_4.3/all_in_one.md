# Power BI Data Modeling & Best Practices – Q&A (All-in-One)

| No. | Question | Answer |
|-----|----------|--------|
| **Q.1** | **What challenges are commonly faced when connecting multiple fact tables in Power BI?** | Common challenges include:<br>• Creating ambiguous relationships (many-to-many or inactive relationships)<br>• Risk of double-counting when multiple fact tables are connected to the same dimension<br>• Filter propagation issues if relationships are not set correctly<br>• Performance degradation due to complex relationship paths<br>• Circular or bidirectional relationship problems leading to ambiguity | 
| **Q.2** | **How can dimension tables be used to link multiple fact tables effectively?** | Use a **star schema** (or snowflake) approach:<br>• Create shared (conformed) dimension tables (e.g., Date, Customer, Product)<br>• Connect each fact table directly to these common dimensions<br>• Avoid direct relationships between fact tables<br>• This creates a clean, unambiguous model where filters flow correctly from dimensions to all related facts | 
| **Q.3** | **What are best practices when modeling data with more than one fact table?** | • Use conformed dimensions<br>• Keep fact tables at the same grain when possible<br>• Prefer a single Date dimension for all facts<br>• Set cross-filter direction to **Single** (from dimension → fact) in most cases<br>• Use bridge tables only when truly needed<br>• Mark your model as a Composite model if combining multiple fact tables with DirectQuery | 
| **Q.4** | **What is filter context in Power BI and how is it applied?** | Filter context is the set of filters automatically applied to a calculation before it is evaluated. It comes from:<br>• Slicers, visual-level filters, page/report filters<br>• Row context from iterators (e.g., SUMX)<br>• Relationships (filters propagate from the “one” side to the “many” side)<br>It determines which rows are visible/included in any DAX measure | 
| **Q.5** | **Explain the concept of filter flow in the data model and how it affects report visuals.** | Filters flow from the “one” side to the “many” side of a relationship by default (single-direction). <br>• A slicer on a dimension table filters all connected fact tables<br>• A visual using fields from multiple fact tables works correctly only if they share common dimensions<br>• Incorrect direction or bi-directional filters can cause unexpected filtering or performance issues | 
| **Q.6** | **What is a bi-directional filter in Power BI, and when should it be used?** | Bi-directional filtering allows filters to flow both ways across a relationship (from fact → dimension and dimension → fact). <br>Use sparingly only when:<br>• You need a slicer on a fact table column to filter a dimension (rare)<br>• Implementing many-to-many relationships with a bridge table<br>• Certain security scenarios (e.g., RLS with user-to-dimension mapping) | 
| **Q.7** | **How can bi-directional filters introduce ambiguity in relationships?** | When multiple paths exist between tables, Power BI may not know which path to use for filter propagation, causing:<br>• Unexpected results (wrong totals)<br>• Ambiguity errors in DAX measures<br>• Double-counting or suppressed rows | 
| **Q.8** | **What is the potential performance impact of using bi-directional filters?** | • Significantly slower query performance (often 5–50× slower)<br>• Larger memory usage<br>• Increased complexity for the engine to resolve filter directions<br>• Can prevent the use of certain query optimizations | 
| **Q.9** | **Why would you want to hide certain fields from the report view in Power BI?** | • Reduce clutter for end users<br>• Prevent accidental misuse of intermediate/key columns<br>• Hide technical columns (e.g., surrogate keys, row identifiers)<br>• Enforce correct model usage (force users to use proper dimensions/measures) | 
| **Q.10** | **How do you hide columns, measures, or tables in Power BI without deleting them?** | • Right-click the field in the Fields pane → **Hide** (or **Hide in report view**)<br>• In Power BI Desktop: View tab → uncheck “Show hidden” to see them again<br>• Hidden fields are still usable in DAX and relationships but won’t appear to report authors | 
| **Q.11** | **What is the impact of hiding fields on user experience and model performance?** | **User Experience:**<br>• Cleaner, less intimidating field list<br>• Guides users toward correct fields and measures<br><br>**Performance:**<br>• No impact on query performance or file size<br>• Hidden fields are still loaded into the model exactly the same way |
